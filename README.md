# snake
This program is a simple game of snake. 

	- You move by holding down the "w", "a", "s", and "d" keys to move(you have to HOLD the key down, if you just press it, it won't update properly),
  and the goal is to eat the food on screen and grow bigger. 
	- If you go past the border or hit yourself, you lose. 
	- If the snake up fills up the entire board, you win. 
	- Press "r" to restart the game. Press "q" to close the window.


	- One issue is that if you go over the border or over your body, the snake won't move if you try to, but trying to move causes the whole game to 
  freeze and the restart button doesn't work anymore. If you don't try to move once you've lost, the restart button works fine. 

	- Also, the food can generate within the snake body but you won't get the point unless the front of the snake gets the food, so if you don't see 
  the food on screen, it might be in the snakes body(this hasn't happened yet though). The other requirements of the program work well.
